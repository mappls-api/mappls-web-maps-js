## Map Events Quick References 

### Listening to Map Events via addListener()

- **load:** 

```js
        map.addListener('load', function () { console.log('load');}); 
```

- **click:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is pressed and released at the same point on the map.

```js
        map.addListener('click', function () { console.log('click');});
```

- **dblclick:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is clicked twice at the same point on the map.

```js
        map.addListener('dblclick', function () { console.log('dblclick');});
```

- **drag:** Fired repeatedly during a "drag to pan" interaction.

```js
        map.addListener('drag', function () { console.log('drag');});
```

- **dragstart:** Fired when a "drag to pan" interaction starts.

```js
        map.addListener('dragstart', function () { console.log('dragstart');});
```

- **dragend:** Fired when a "drag to pan" interaction ends.

```js
        map.addListener('dragend', function () { console.log('dragend');});
```

- **idle:** Fired after the last frame rendered before the map enters an "idle" state:
    - No camera transitions are in progress
    - All currently requested tiles have loaded
    - All fade/transition animations have completed

```js
        map.addListener('idle', function () { console.log('idle');});
```

- **mousemove:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved within the map.

```js
        map.addListener('mousemove', function () { console.log('mousemove');});
```

- **mouseout:** Fired when a point device (usually a mouse) leaves the map's canvas

```js
        map.addListener('mouseout', function () { console.log('mouseout');});
```

- **mouseover:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved within the map.

```js
        map.addListener('mouseover', function () { console.log('mouseover');});
```

- **mouseup:** Fired when a pointing device button (usually the left mouse button) is released after being pressed on the map.

```js
        map.addListener('mouseup', function () { console.log('mouseup');});
```

- **mousedown:** Fired when a pointing device button (usually the left mouse button) is pressed down on the map.

```js
        map.addListener('mousedown', function () { console.log('mousedown');});
```

- **mouseenter:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) enters the boundary of a map layer or feature that has event listeners attached.

```js
        map.addListener('mouseenter', function () { console.log('mouseenter');});
```

- **mouseleave:** Fired when a pointing device (usually a mouse) leaves the boundary of a map layer or feature that has event listeners attached.

```js
        map.addListener('mouseleave', function () { console.log('mouseleave');});
```

- **contextmenu:** Fired when the right button of the mouse is clicked or the context menu key is pressed within the map.

```js
        map.addListener('contextmenu', function () { console.log('contextmenu');});
```

- **wheel:** Fired when a wheel event occurs within the map.

```js
        map.addListener('wheel', function () { console.log('wheel');});
```

- **touchstart:** Fired when one or more fingers touch the map’s surface. This event marks the beginning of a touch interaction.

```js
        map.addListener('touchstart', function () { console.log('touchstart');});
```

- **touchmove:** Fired continuously as a finger moves across the map’s surface during a touch interaction.

```js
        map.addListener('touchmove', function () { console.log('touchmove');});
```

- **touchend:** Fired when a touchend event occurs within the map.

```js
        map.addListener('touchend', function () { console.log('touchend');});
```

- **touchcancel:** Fired when a touch interaction is interrupted or canceled unexpectedly — for example, if an alert box appears or the system cancels the gesture.
```js
        map.addListener('touchcancel', function () { console.log('touchcancel');});
```


- **movestart:** Fired when the map movement (panning, zooming, rotating, or pitching) starts, usually at the beginning of an animated transition or user interaction.

```js
        map.addListener('movestart', function () { console.log('movestart');});
```

- **move:** Fired repeatedly during an animated transition from one view to another.

```js
        map.addListener('move', function () { console.log('move');});
```

- **moveend:** Fired just after the map completes a transition from one view to another.

```js
        map.addListener('moveend', function () { console.log('moveend');});
```

- **rotatestart:** Fired when the map’s bearing (rotation) starts changing, either by user interaction (drag to rotate) or programmatically.

```js
        map.addListener('rotatestart', function () { console.log('rotatestart');});
```

- **rotate:** ired continuously while the map’s bearing (rotation) is changing during a drag or animation.

```js
        map.addListener('rotate', function () { console.log('rotate');});
```

- **rotateend:** Fired when the map’s bearing (rotation) finishes changing, after the rotation interaction or animation completes.
```js
        map.addListener('rotateend', function () { console.log('rotateend');});
```

- **pitchstart:** Fired when the map’s tilt (pitch) starts changing, either by user interaction or methods.

```js
        map.addListener('pitchstart', function () { console.log('pitchstart');});
```

- **pitch:** Fired continuously while the map’s tilt (pitch) is changing due to user interaction or methods.
```js
        map.addListener('pitch', function () { console.log('pitch');});
```

- **pitchend:** Fired immediately after the map's pitch (tilt) finishes changing as the result of either user interaction or methods.

```js
        map.addListener('pitchend', function () { console.log('pitchend');});
```

- **zoomstart:** Fired when zooming starts.

```js
        map.addListener('zoomstart', function () { console.log('zoomstart');});
```

- **zoom:** Fired continuously during zoom interactions.

```js
        map.addListener('zoom', function () { console.log('zoom');});
```

- **zoomend:** Fired when a zoom interaction ends.

```js
        map.addListener('zoomend', function () { console.log('zoomend');});
```

- **render:** Fired whenever the map is repainted. This occurs frequently during animations, movements, or visual updates on the map.

```js
        map.addListener('render', function () { console.log('render');});
```

- **sourcedataloading:** Fired when the map starts loading data for a source, such as vector tiles, GeoJSON, or raster imagery. It indicates that the source data request has been initiated.

```js
        map.addListener('sourcedataloading', function () { console.log('sourcedataloading');});
```

- **sourcedata:** Fired when the map successfully loads or updates data from a source. This event helps you track when source data (like tiles or features) has finished loading and is ready for use.

```js
        map.addListener('sourcedata', function () { console.log('sourcedata');});
```

- **styledataloading:** Fired when the map begins loading a new style or when style resources (such as layers, sources, or images) are being fetched or reloaded.

```js
        map.addListener('styledataloading', function () { console.log('styledataloading');});
```

- **styledata:** Fired when the map’s style data has finished loading or updating. This means all style elements (like layers and sources) are fully available for rendering.

```js
        map.addListener('styledata', function () { console.log('styledata');});
```

- **data:** Fired whenever any map data (such as style, source, or tile information) is loaded or updated. This helps track ongoing updates that affect rendering, including new tiles or modified layers.

```js
        map.addListener('data', function () { console.log('data');});
```

- **resize:** Fired when the map’s container is resized. This event occurs whenever the map’s dimensions change — for example, when the browser window is resized or the map container’s CSS size changes.

```js
        map.addListener('resize', function () { console.log('resize');});
```

- **remove:** Fired when the map instance is removed from the DOM using map.remove(). This signals that the map’s WebGL context and event listeners are being cleaned up.

```js
        map.addListener('remove', function () { console.log('remove');});
```

- **error:** Fired when the map encounters an error while loading resources, sources, or rendering. This event is useful for debugging and handling unexpected map failures.

```js
        map.addListener('error', function () { console.log('error');});
```

- **webglcontextlost:** Fired when the map’s WebGL context is lost, usually due to GPU resource limits or browser tab suspension. During this time, rendering stops until the context is restored.

```js
        map.addListener('webglcontextlost', function () { console.log('webglcontextlost');});
```

- **webglcontextrestored:** Fired when the WebGL context that was previously lost is successfully restored. This allows the map to resume rendering after a graphics reset.

```js
        map.addListener('webglcontextrestored', function () { console.log('webglcontextrestored');});
```

**Event System**:

1. `addListener:` Pass Event & Callback
2. `clearListeners:` Remove Event
3. `addListenerOnce:` Same as addListener but call once

**Example**

```js
    map.addListener('load', function () { console.log('loaded');}); 
```
